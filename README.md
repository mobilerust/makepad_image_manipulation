# Image rendering 

This is a simple application used for benchmarking image rendering in Makepad, it consists of a grid of animated images. 

The images either rotate, scale or fade out:

You can find the benchmark results and how to run your own measurements in [this document](https://www.notion.so/wyewrks/Benchmark-Image-rendering-performance-under-Upscaling-f3ffdd6c75ef4748969afa037397bd0a)

We also compared Makepad's results against Flutter and Native. You can find their implementations under [/benchmark_comparisons](benchmark_comparisons)
